| Negation | Add pseudo-triggers using synonyms of "change", like "growth", "spread", as well as "no evidence of change/growth/spread". |   |
| Hypothetical | The list of hypothetical triggers provided was rather short. I would suggest adding "avoidance of" and "avoid" to the hypothetical triggers list, so that sentence like this get caught: "Patient should try to avoid `<CoreConcept>`" and "Recommend avoidance of `<CoreConcept>`" |   |
| Hypothetical | There are a couple of other sentence structures that I think should be marked as hypothetical, but I cannot think of any obvious way to look for them. If you can, great. If not, it's not so bad, as these example structures are... well, hypothetical: "`<CoreConcept>` caused by either `<CoreConcept>` or `<CoreConcept>`" "`<CoreConcept>` was prepped but not used" "... possible `<CoreConcept>`"   "plan to `<CoreConcept>`..."  "may have `<CoreConcept>`"|  |
| Family History | Context misses sentences like this"Patient's <family member>, who is 30 years older than him, has `<CoreConcept>`" I'm not sure why, though. |   |
